# Speaking

I share practical insights about AI implementation and team leadership at conferences, meetups, and industry events. My talks focus on real-world experience building production AI systems and managing AI engineering teams.

## Featured Talks

### 2025

**[Your AI Agents lie to you. Think you can catch them? (Rhein-Neckar AI & Data Hub)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcaHyFxKg9I)** - September 4, 2025  
*AI Agent Reliability, Production AI Systems, AI Alignment*

This is my public talk from Rhein-Neckar AI & Data Hub in Heidelberg where I present research on detecting unfaithfulness in AI agent reasoning traces. Through analysis of 2,800 production agent traces, I demonstrate how to systematically identify when AI agents are being deceptive about their reasoning process and decision-making.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- AI agent faithfulness and reliability challenges
- Systematic detection of deceptive reasoning patterns
- Evolution from naive keyword matching to sophisticated failure mode analysis
- Practical tools for production AI system monitoring
- Real-world case studies of agent unfaithfulness

**[3 Mistakes to Avoid Before Choosing an AI Agent Framework (LLM Practitioners Meetup Karlsruhe)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAY48ruMp7s)** - July 31, 2025  
*AI Agent Frameworks, Framework Selection, Production AI*

This is my public talk from LLM Practitioners Meetup Karlsruhe in July 2025 where I share insights on selecting the right AI agent framework, avoiding common pitfalls, and understanding key considerations such as framework architecture & archetypes, control versus development velocity, and real-world application suitability.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Framework architecture and archetypes analysis
- Control versus development velocity trade-offs
- Real-world application suitability assessment
- Common framework selection mistakes
- Practical evaluation criteria for AI agent frameworks
