# Speaking

I share practical insights about AI implementation and team leadership at conferences, meetups, and industry events. My talks focus on real-world experience building production AI systems and managing AI engineering teams.

## Featured Talks

### 2025

**[AI Strategy in a Six Month World: Leading When Long Term Planning Is Dead (DevFest Hamburg 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G16JdRRawwg)** - November 15, 2025
*AI Strategy, AI Transformation, Leadership, Rapid Iteration, Organizational Change*

In this talk, I share insights gathered from conversations with various companies about their approaches to AI transformation. I emphasize the rapid pace of AI advancements and the impracticality of planning beyond six months, focusing on prioritizing tangible AI value over hype, investing in talent, and the necessity of fast iteration cycles.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- The six-month AI strategy cycle in a rapidly evolving landscape
- Three essential bets: AI coding assistants, observability & evaluation, talent transformation
- Seven-step framework for developing effective AI strategy
- Business alignment, readiness assessments, and risk mapping
- Build vs. buy decisions in AI implementation
- Fast iteration cycles and flexible execution approach

**[Your AI Agents lie to you. Think you can catch them? (Rhein-Neckar AI & Data Hub)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcaHyFxKg9I)** - September 4, 2025
*AI Agent Reliability, Production AI Systems, AI Alignment*

This is my public talk from Rhein-Neckar AI & Data Hub in Heidelberg where I present research on detecting unfaithfulness in AI agent reasoning traces. Through analysis of 2,800 production agent traces, I demonstrate how to systematically identify when AI agents are being deceptive about their reasoning process and decision-making.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- AI agent faithfulness and reliability challenges
- Systematic detection of deceptive reasoning patterns
- Evolution from naive keyword matching to sophisticated failure mode analysis
- Practical tools for production AI system monitoring
- Real-world case studies of agent unfaithfulness

**[3 Mistakes to Avoid Before Choosing an AI Agent Framework (LLM Practitioners Meetup Karlsruhe)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAY48ruMp7s)** - July 31, 2025  
*AI Agent Frameworks, Framework Selection, Production AI*

This is my public talk from LLM Practitioners Meetup Karlsruhe in July 2025 where I share insights on selecting the right AI agent framework, avoiding common pitfalls, and understanding key considerations such as framework architecture & archetypes, control versus development velocity, and real-world application suitability.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Framework architecture and archetypes analysis
- Control versus development velocity trade-offs
- Real-world application suitability assessment
- Common framework selection mistakes
- Practical evaluation criteria for AI agent frameworks
