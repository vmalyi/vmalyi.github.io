# From REST APIs to MCPs: The Strategic Shift Any Company Offering API Endpoints Must Make Now

--8<-- "youtube-cta.md"

Chances are your most progressive customers are actually dealing with a serious challenge when interacting with your SaaS over the REST API you offer them. They're building AI agents which use your API endpoints as tools… but with no success.

## Your API endpoints are the bottleneck now

Every response from your traditional REST API consumes hundreds or thousands of tokens of your customers' AI models and that's before we even talk about the OpenAPI spec their AI Agents need to understand how to use it. And all of this without any kind of guarantee that those AI agents are using your APIs correctly. They're paying for every token their AI system processes, and your REST API is the expensive part of their stack.

But token costs are just the beginning. Traditional APIs were designed when humans wrote code and machines executed instructions. That fundamental assumption breaks down completely with AI agents. Humans can read your beautiful documentation, understand the idea behind a certain API endpoint, and write appropriate error handling. What about AI agents? They need to transmit your entire API structure with every single request/invocation as a tool (because of REST's stateless nature) and somehow maintain coherent context across multiple calls.

I've watched teams burn weeks trying to get their AI agents to reliably use enterprise APIs as tools. One startup I know spent thousands in OpenAI credits just testing their integration with a payment provider's API. Why? Because every interaction required sending the full API documentation, previous responses, and business context. The AI had to relearn the entire system with each call.

Regardless of what kind of services you are offering through your API endpoints: they're no longer suitable for the current reality where there are only other backends/services interacting with them.
But there is good news: you can solve this with MCPs.

## What MCP Actually Looks Like

MCP was [open-sourced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) by Anthropic in November 2024, and within weeks, major players jumped on board. We're not talking about some experimental protocol that might gain traction. Microsoft, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI are already [building support](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-open-source-model-context-protocol-was-just-updated-heres-why-its-a-big-deal/) (check those [16,324 MCPs](https://mcp.so) – at the time of writing – being indexed by one of those MCP directories).
So what makes MCP different? Three things that matter:

**Dynamic Discovery**: Your MCP server advertises its capabilities. AI agents discover what you offer without documentation. No more hardcoded integrations breaking when you ship updates.

**Stateful Context**: Unlike REST's stateless model, MCP maintains context across interactions. The AI doesn't need to retransmit your entire business logic with every request.

**Native Tool Primitives**: MCP organizes everything into tools (functions the AI can execute), resources (data streams), and prompts (reusable templates). It's built for how AI actually works, not how humans code.

## The Money You're Leaving on the Table
It's not just about keeping customers, it's an additional revenue stream. Companies offering traditional APIs are stuck in a commodity pricing race to the bottom. Meanwhile, those offering AI-optimized interfaces through MCPs are commanding premium prices. We're talking 25-40% higher rates for essentially the same underlying functionality.

Think about it. You're not selling API requests anymore. You're selling additional context for AI agents that your customers are building (or will be building soon). Gartner [predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027) at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously through agentic AI by 2028, up from 0% in 2024. That's millions of AI agents that need to interact with your services. Each one is a potential customer for your MCP endpoints.

The math is brutal for companies ignoring this shift. The agentic AI market is expected to [explode](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/agentic-ai-market) from $5.25 billion in 2024 to $199.05 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 43.84%. Every API-based company will either capture part of this growth or become irrelevant because AI systems are not able to interact with its services.

## Breaking Down the Myths
Let me destroy some myths that are keeping you from making money.

**Myth: "Our REST/GraphQL API with good documentation is AI-ready"**
Reality check: LLMs can't dynamically learn from documentation. They can't browse your developer portal and figure things out like a human developer would. Every single interaction requires transmitting your entire API structure. REST's statelessness forces constant context retransmission, inflating costs and degrading performance. That beautiful REST API definition schema you're so proud of? It's worthless when the AI needs to understand business logic that lives in your docs, not your schema.

I watched a team try to connect their AI agent to multiple internal REST API endpoints last month. Of course there was pristine OpenAPI documentation. Took them three days and $2,000 in API costs just to get the AI Agent to reliably perform CRUD operations. The same integration with an MCP server? Two hours.

**Myth: "MCP will replace all APIs"**
Nobody's throwing away REST. MCP wraps your existing APIs, it doesn't replace them. Think of it as an AI-optimized translation layer sitting on top of your current infrastructure. Human developers keep using REST and GraphQL. AI agents use MCP interfaces to the same services. You maintain one codebase, serve an additional audience of early AI agents and (maybe) charge premium prices for the AI-friendly version.

## How much time do you have as a SaaS to adopt MCPs
This isn't some distant future scenario. 72% of decision-makers [anticipate](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/) broader adoption of generative AI tools in the near future. Your customers are building AI agents right now. If you're not offering MCP endpoints by end-2025, you're basically telling them to find another vendor.
I'm watching companies make the same mistake they made with mobile in 2008. "Our desktop site works fine on phones." Remember how that worked out? The companies that built mobile-first experiences captured the market. The ones that didn't became MySpace.

The transition timeline is compressed this time. With mobile, one had years to adapt. With AI agents, you've got just a couple of months. Maybe less. 33% of enterprise software applications [will include](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-21-gartner-identifies-the-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2025) agentic AI by 2026, up from less than 1% in 2024. That's not gradual adoption, that's a cliff.

And before you think this is just Silicon Valley hype, look at who's moving. Walmart's [building](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2025/05/29/inside-walmarts-strategy-for-building-an-agentic-future) AI agents for inventory. JPMorgan's [using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMalr0jiOAc) them for investment research. These aren't startups burning VC money. These are conservative enterprises that move slowly. When they're all moving in the same direction, something fundamental has shifted.

## Your Implementation Reality

Now let's get practical. Building MCP support isn't some massive rewrite. You're basically creating a translation layer. Your existing API logic stays the same. You're just presenting it differently.
Start small. Pick your highest-value endpoint—the one enterprise customers pay the most for. Build an MCP wrapper for just that functionality. Test it with a customer who's struggling with AI integration. I guarantee they'll give you feedback that shapes your entire strategy.

The technical lift is smaller than you think. Anthropic provides SDKs in Python and TypeScript. You can have a proof of concept running in a week. A production server maybe in a month.

But here's where companies screw up: they treat MCP like a technical project instead of a product strategy. Your MCP interface isn't just your API with different syntax. It's a chance to rethink how AI agents interact with your service. What context do they really need? How can you minimize token usage? What patterns do you see in how they use your API?

One B2B SaaS CTO I recently had a chat with discovered their AI agent customers were making 10 API calls to accomplish what should be a single operation. They redesigned their MCP interface to provide composite operations. Token usage dropped 80%. They rolled out MCP access and customer satisfaction went through the roof.

## The Competitive Reality

The enterprise software market is about to split into two categories: AI-native and legacy. Guess which category commands premium pricing? Guess which one enterprise buyers are standardizing on?

This is like the SaaS transition all over again. Remember when on-premise software vendors insisted cloud was just hype? How'd that work out for them? The only difference is this transition will happen faster because the infrastructure already exists. You don't need to build data centers. You just need to wrap your APIs.

## What This Means for Your Business Model

The transition from APIs to MCPs represents not merely a technical evolution but a fundamental business transformation as profound as the shift to mobile or cloud computing. You're not just changing how you deliver functionality. You're changing what you sell, how you price it, and who your customers are.

Today, you sell access to your APIs. Tomorrow, you'll sell AI capabilities and charge for outcomes. Today, the consumers of your APIs are other services and backends. Tomorrow, they're AI agents making autonomous decisions.

The pricing models alone will transform your economics. Instead of racing to the bottom on per-call pricing, you'll charge for value delivered. An AI agent that uses your MCP to automate a workflow isn't counting API calls—it's measuring business impact. Price accordingly.

## The Bottom Line
Companies clinging to REST-only strategies are writing their own obituaries. Not because REST is bad. No, it's not. But because they're ignoring how their customers' needs have fundamentally changed. AI agents aren't just another client type. They're a completely different consumption model that requires different infrastructure.

The window for strategic positioning is narrowing rapidly. First movers will define the standards, capture the premium customers, and establish the pricing models everyone else has to follow.

The question for leadership isn't whether to offer MCPs alongside your traditional REST APIs. It's how quickly you can move to capture the massive opportunity they represent. Because while you're reading this, your competitors are already building. And your customers are looking for ways to provide essential context for their AI agents.
