## Helping AI Leaders Avoid Expensive Mistakes

I help CTOs, Chief AI Officers, and AI Directors navigate the treacherous landscape of enterprise AI implementation. With 16 years in technology leadership and 3+ years building AI platform teams, I've seen where the bodies are buried.

## What You'll Find Here

**The Brutal Truth About AI Implementation**
- Why 67% of AI projects fail and how to avoid joining them
- Real case studies of $5M+ AI initiatives that went wrong (with actual numbers)
- The hidden costs that kill AI ROI before you see it coming

**Practical Leadership Frameworks** 
- ROI measurement strategies that survive CFO scrutiny
- Vendor evaluation frameworks for the 500+ AI tools flooding your inbox
- Team building approaches that actually drive AI adoption (not resistance)

**Industry-Specific Guidance**
- Financial services: Building explainable AI for regulatory reporting
- Healthcare: HIPAA-compliant workflows that don't break functionality  
- Manufacturing: AI integration with 20-year-old systems

## Why I Write

Your board wants AI results. Your budget is under scrutiny. Your team is skeptical. One hallucination scandal could end your AI transformation (and possibly your role).

I've been in the trenches where demos fail in production, where AWS bills explode overnight, and where legal teams kill projects at the last minute. This content exists to help you navigate these realities without becoming another cautionary tale.

## My Approach: Paranoid but Practical

No hype. No "revolutionary transformation" promises. Just experience-based guidance for leaders who need AI to actually work in the real world.

Whether it's preventing vendor lock-in disasters, building compliance-first architecture, or managing the organizational change that everyone underestimates, I focus on the unglamorous but critical work that determines success or failure.
