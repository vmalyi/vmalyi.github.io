## AI Implementation Experience from the Trenches

With 16 years in technology leadership and 3+ years building AI platform teams, I've experienced the reality of enterprise AI implementation - both the successes and spectacular failures. I share practical insights from this journey.

## What You'll Find Here

**The Brutal Truth About AI Implementation**
- Why 67% of AI projects fail and how to avoid joining them
- Real case studies of $5M+ AI initiatives that went wrong (with actual numbers)
- The hidden costs that kill AI ROI before you see it coming

**Practical Leadership Frameworks** 
- ROI measurement strategies that survive CFO scrutiny
- Vendor evaluation frameworks for the 500+ AI tools flooding your inbox
- Team building approaches that actually drive AI adoption (not resistance)

**Industry-Specific Guidance**

- Healthcare: HIPAA-compliant workflows that don't break functionality  
- Manufacturing: AI integration with 20-year-old systems

## Why I Share This

I've witnessed AI projects where demos worked perfectly but production deployments failed catastrophically. I've seen AWS bills explode from $10K to $100K overnight. I've watched legal teams kill projects at the last minute.

These experiences shaped my understanding of what actually works (and doesn't work) in enterprise AI implementation.

## My Perspective: Practical Over Theoretical

No hype. No "revolutionary transformation" promises. Just real-world experience from someone who has built AI systems that run in production, managed teams through AI adoption challenges, and learned from both successes and expensive mistakes.

I focus on the practical, unglamorous work that actually determines whether AI projects succeed or join the graveyard of failed initiatives.
