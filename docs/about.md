## Why I Share This Experience

AI implementation requires more than technical knowledge—it demands understanding of team dynamics, business alignment, compliance requirements, and operational realities. My goal is to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and business outcomes through practical, hands-on experience.

Having built systems that run in production, led teams through AI adoption, and established enterprise AI platforms, I focus on sharing what actually works rather than theoretical approaches.
