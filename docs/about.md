# About Viktor Malyi

## Professional Background

I've built and scaled AI platforms from concept to production, serving 2M+ users while maintaining enterprise-grade GDPR compliance. Over 16 years in technology, I've established AI strategy for organizations, led cross-functional teams, and delivered AI systems that actually generate business value. Based in Heilbronn, Germany, I founded and built the AI Platform strategy at simpleclub from the ground up.

## Career Journey

### AI Platform Strategy & Execution (2024-Present)
**Building AI-First Organization at Scale**

Established comprehensive AI platform strategy serving 2M+ users across external and internal systems. Built 5 production AI-powered features with zero GDPR violations while maintaining enterprise compliance standards. Designed platform architecture that enabled AI adoption across entire engineering organization, transforming both product capabilities and internal development workflows.

### Technical Leadership Foundation (2022-2024)
**Scaling Engineering Operations & Team Growth**

Led mobile development initiatives while building the technical foundation for AI transformation. Increased system reliability (reduced crashes 21%) and code quality (0→52% test coverage) across user-facing applications. Managed team expansion and hiring while establishing development processes that later enabled rapid AI feature deployment.

## Why I Share This Experience

AI implementation requires more than technical knowledge—it demands understanding of team dynamics, business alignment, compliance requirements, and operational realities. My goal is to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and business outcomes through practical, hands-on experience.

Having built systems that run in production, led teams through AI adoption, and established enterprise AI platforms, I focus on sharing what actually works rather than theoretical approaches.
