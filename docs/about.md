# About Viktor Malyi

## Professional Background

I'm an AI implementation expert with 16 years of experience in technology and over 3 years leading AI platform teams. Based in Heilbronn, Germany, I specialize in practical, anti-hype approaches to AI adoption and building systems that actually work in production.

## Expertise

- **AI Platform Leadership**: Building and scaling AI engineering teams
- **Production AI Systems**: Deploying and maintaining AI solutions at scale
- **Framework Selection**: Choosing the right tools and technologies for AI projects
- **Team Building**: Growing high-performing engineering teams
- **Practical Implementation**: Moving beyond theory to real-world AI solutions

## Philosophy

I believe in practical over theoretical approaches to AI. My focus is on sharing real implementation experience rather than promoting theoretical concepts. I emphasize building systems that work reliably in production environments.

## Experience

With 16 years in technology and 3+ years specifically in AI platform leadership, I've seen the evolution of AI from experimental projects to mission-critical production systems. I share insights from this journey to help other teams avoid common pitfalls and build successful AI implementations.
