## Why I Share This Experience

Building AI systems in production teaches you lessons that theory alone cannot provide. Technical leadership in AI requires understanding not just the technology, but how teams adopt it, how to measure its impact, and how to build it reliably.

I share practical insights from leading AI platform development, building technical teams, and implementing AI systems that serve real users. My focus is on what actually works in practice rather than what sounds good in presentations.
