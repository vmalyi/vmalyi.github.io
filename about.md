Hi! I’m Viktor Malyi. The Flutter/iOS developer who is passionate about mobile development, machine learning, accessibility, product development and leading teams.

I have 12 years experience in software development as a software developer and software engineer in test. Throughout this time I continuously improve my design, user experience, and product design skills which makes me more efficient at any stage of product development.

I love creating products which solve real people problems. [AutoWorkout](http://autoworkout.app/) is one of such products which uses neural networks and Apple’s Core ML to automatically recognize fitness exercises and provide workout statistics for those who love the sport.

Another highlight is [I Have Voice app](https://ihavevoice.app/) which allows people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to communicate with the world.

I’m always open to new challenges which make me learn new stuff, provide value to others and allow remote work.
