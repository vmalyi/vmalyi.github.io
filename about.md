Hi! I’m Viktor Malyi. The developer who is passionate about mobile development, machine learning, and product development.

I have 10 years experience in software development as a software developer and software engineer in test. Throughout this time I constantly improve my design, user experience, and product design skills which makes me more efficient at any stage of product development.

I love creating products which solve real people problems. I’m happy when I can use machine learning to do this as well. [AutoWorkout](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id1314314336) is one of such products which utilizes neural networks and Apple’s Core ML to recognize fitness exercises and provide workout statistics for those who love sport.

I’m always open to new challenges which make me learn new stuff, provide value to others and allow at least partially remote work. [Contact me](mailto:v.stratus@gmail.com) if you have ones.
