I’m a seasoned leader in software development, currently focused on embedding AI/ML into core business processes, products, and features to drive innovation and efficiency.

With expertise across AI/ML (from the early days, even before this became a hype), mobile engineering (iOS and Flutter), and quality assurance (both manual and automated), I bring a full-spectrum understanding of software development, having advanced from hands-on roles to leading teams.

I’m also passionate about creating forward-thinking products, including **I Have Voice** and **Autoworkout**, which were ahead of their time in delivering unique user experiences and functionality.
